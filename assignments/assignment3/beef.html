          "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

        <p>
          I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.
        </p>

				I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.
			</p>

			<p>
				We need the tonic of wildness...At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature.
			</p>

			<p>
				Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the earth.
			</p>

			<p>
				However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace.
			</p>

			<p>
				As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Things do not change; we change.
			</p>

			<p>
				The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.
			</p>

			<p>
				We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us even in our soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavour. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.
			</p>

			<p>
				All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be.
			</p>

			<p>
				Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.
			</p>

			<p>
				A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.
			</p>

			<p>
				Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new.
			</p>

			<p>
				Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.
			</p>

			<p>
				My greatest skill in life has been to want but little
			</p>

			<p>
				How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book.
			</p>

			<p>
				I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.
			</p>

			<p>
        As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.

        Things do not change; we change.
        Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughtsâ€¦ Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.
